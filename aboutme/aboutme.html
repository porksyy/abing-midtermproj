      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then transferred to <abbr title ="St. Andrew's School Inc.">SAS</abbr>, for the remainder of my elementary days.<sup>14</sup> This was also the start of my eyes already getting blurry so I had to get glasses at a young age of 11 years old.<sup>15</sup> It was difficult at the time since I had to get used to wearing glasses everyday, or else I would have a difficult time at school.<sup>16</sup> I remember being excited when I was in 6th grade since the year after, I would be a highschool student.<sup>17</sup> I just liked the tone of being a highschool student and it made me think that I would be mature that time.<sup>18</sup> We had a "gratitude night" nearing the end of my grade 6 year.<sup>19</sup> It was similar to a prom and we had to practice dances weeks before the event itself.<sup>20</sup> I remember being excited in the morning of the event since it was going to be my first time wearing a tuxedo and I was thinking to myself that I was going to be so cool and look like an adult<sup>21</sup>.</p><br>

We still meet up from time to time whenever we have free time. <sup>5</sup> It was also my first grasp at relationships and it taught me a lot;more than what I needed to know.<sup>6</sup>We were both a lesson to each other and I believe it made us into a better person.<sup>7</sup>I also made a lot of memories which I can remember vividly.<sup>8</sup>One notable memory was that when we were finishing our clearance, everyone was scrambling around trying to find the teachers so that they can sign their clearance.<sup>9</sup> There was a point where almost everyone was in the room at the time and we were generally tired since the teachers were also busy with other students. <sup>10</sup>Everyone was just chilling at our room and my classmate played a song over the speaker.<sup>11</sup> It was a playlist of 2000s R&B songs and pretty much everyone knew the lyrics to the songs so we were all just singing along and just having a good time in general.<sup>12</sup><br><br>
        
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, everyone got back to completing their clearance.<sup>13</sup> Initially, I was tired since I kept walking all day but when my classmate played those songs, I got an energy recharge and I was feeling active again.<sup>14</sup> I also met a plenty of teachers that would change how I viewed certain subjects.<sup>15</sup> One particular teacher was Ms. Zeth, my research teacher at the time.<sup>16</sup> Before she was my teacher, I hated doing research since it was too time consuming and I just did not like it.<sup>17</sup> When Ms. Zeth became my teacher, she was so passionate in teaching research that it made me listen attentively to her class.<sup>18</sup> It got to the point where I was actually excited on certain days because we would have our research subject on that day.<sup>19</sup> From then on, I never really dreaded research that much.<sup>20</sup><br><br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only have two years left as a student, assuming I do not fail any subjects wherein I have to retake them another sem.<sup>11</sup>The thoughts that I had before becoming a freshman is coming back to me.<sup>12</sup>I will be a 3 year student next sem and everything is just going so fast.<sup>13</sup> I am also sort of excited because after being a student, I will be going in the real world, most probably on my own since everyone will have different paths by the time we graduate.<sup>14</sup> I am lucky that I am surrounded by people where I am comfortable in being myself.<sup>15</sup> I am not pressured to live up to a certain expectation just for them to like me.<sup>16</sup> I do not regret enrolling in UE at all.<sup>17</sup> In fact, I sometimes wonder how different my life would have been if I enrolled in a different college.<sup>18</sup> Would I have the same type of friends that I have now? Or would I have friends who are totally different? Or would I even have friends at all?<sup>19</sup> All these are just mere thoughts, I still am grateful for the people around me.<sup>20</sup> I still have a lot to learn, but I will do my best and have fun with my remaining years as a student.<sup>21</sup>
