Although, I already knew how to code when I was still in Junior High School. I was interested at the time and I was curious on how to code since it looked cool. Another skill that I possess is that I can play badminton well. I have been playing since I was 12 years old. My dad and I used to play badminton every weekend and occasionally with my sister as well. We would drive down to the court and we were there often where it got to the point where the staff already knew us. I remember always trying my best to defeat him but I was not that proficient before. We would play for hours until we were both tired but mostly it was just me who got tired first.

I started cooking frequently at the height of the covid-19 pandemic. Since we were pretty much in our home most of the time, I had a lot of spare time. The first thing I cooked at the time was cheese-stuffed potato balls. I still cooked it a few times after that since I loved how it tasted. Another favorite hobby of mine is to play video games. It is my go-to hobby when I have nothing to do since everytime I play, I always have a good time; even if I get stressed sometimes. A hobby im trying to get into is reading although I am having a hard time trying to fit it into my life right now considering my hectic schedule.

      <p style = "font-family:Tahoma,'Trebuchet Ms',Verdana,Oswald;font-size:1.125em;line-height:1.8em">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One interest I have that not many people know about is that I love museums. I just like to admire every installation whether it be paintings, sculptures, or dioramas. Although, I prefer sculptures than the others but they are beautiful nonetheless. I donâ€™t remember how I got interested in art. It just popped into my mind one day and went from there. I would always be excited back in Junior High when our field trip was going to be in a museum. It made me look forward to the day even more. Not a lot of people know about this certain interest which is wht they are always surprised when I tell them that I love museums since I do not look like someone who would like them.</p>
